Codex was released last August through our API and is the principal building block of GitHub Copilot.\n\nWarp is a Rust-based terminal, reimagined from the ground up to help both individuals and teams be more productive in the command-line.\n\nTerminal commands are typically difficult to remember, find and construct. Users often have to leave the terminal and search the web for answers and even then the results might not give them the right command to execute. Warp uses Codex to allow users to run a natural language command to search directly from within the terminal and get a result they can immediately use.\n\n\u201cCodex allows Warp to make the terminal more accessible and powerful. Developers search for entire commands using natural language rather than trying to remember them or assemble them piecemeal. Codex-powered command search has become one of our game changing features.\u201d\n\n\u2014Zach Lloyd, Founder, Warp\n\n\nMachinet helps professional Java developers write quality code by using Codex to generate intelligent unit test templates.\n\nMachinet was able to accelerate their development several-fold by switching from building their own machine learning systems to using Codex. The flexibility of Codex allows for the ability to easily add new features and capabilities saving their users time and helping them be more productive.\n\n\u201cCodex is an amazing tool in our arsenal.
